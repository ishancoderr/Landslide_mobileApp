# landslide_ditector


## Conditions of the land.

Here we considered whether the landslides causative factors related to surface. And,
checked whether those factors met the relevant condition to cause a landslide by the use of susceptibility map(WoE model)

## Rainfall at the moment.

 Here we consider rainfall condition data and duration of rainfall. Then,
 calculate occurrence probability of landslide because of rainfall(Using machine learning model)
