# landslide_ditector


## Conditions of the land.

Here we considered whether the landslides causative factors related to surface. And,
checked whether those factors met the relevant condition to cause a landslide by the use of susceptibility map(WoE model)

## Rainfall at the moment.

 Here we consider rainfall condition data and duration of rainfall. Then,
 calculate occurrence probability of landslide because of rainfall(Using machine learning model)

## Futher Implementations

-If the user is in a risky area give directions to a safer location after creating 
a GIS network map of low risk areas & connect them with our mobile application.
-Display data regarding past hazard scenarios which enables users to be aware of the seriousness of the situation.
-Enable the users to report a hazard through our application which can be used in future implementations.
-Develop the app as we can send a notification to the user if there is a considerable risk that we see firsthand.
